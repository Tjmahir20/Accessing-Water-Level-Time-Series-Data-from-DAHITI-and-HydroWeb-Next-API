# Project Title

Accessing-Water-Level-Time-Series-Data-from-DAHITI-and-HydroWeb-Next-API

# Overview

This project is dedicated to simplifying the process of accessing water level time series data from two prominent altimetry-based datasets: DAHITI (Digital Elevation Model for Hydrology and Ice Tracking) and HydroWeb.

## DAHITI Dataset

[DAHITI](https://dahiti.dgfi.tum.de/) provides digital elevation models specifically designed for hydrological and ice tracking applications. It employs satellite altimetry data to derive precise water surface elevations globally. The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers, hydrologists, and environmental scientists, offering a comprehensive and accurate representation of water bodies.

## HydroWeb Altimetry-Based Dataset

[HydroWeb](https://www.hydroweb-theonf.org/) is a repository of altimetry-based datasets primarily focused on hydrological applications. It incorporates data from various altimeters, providing detailed water level time series information for rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. HydroWeb is particularly useful for studying water dynamics, understanding hydrological processes, and supporting water resource management.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to facilitate the retrieval and utilization of water level time series data from both the DAHITI and HydroWeb altimetry-based datasets. By providing scripts, tools, and documentation, we aim to empower researchers and developers to effortlessly integrate these valuable datasets into their projects, analyses, and research initiatives.

Whether you are working on hydrological modeling, environmental monitoring, or water resource management, the tools provided here will streamline the process of accessing and processing altimetry-based water level data, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of your work.

By centralizing access to these datasets, our project aims to contribute to the broader community of scientists and practitioners who leverage altimetry data for understanding and managing water resources globally.
